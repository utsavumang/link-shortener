# link-shortener
A minimal, session authenticated URL shortening service which may be used for beautification, tracking clicks or disguising original address.

Built using **Node.js, Express, EJS, and MongoDB**. The frontend is kept intentionally simple to focus on core backend learning.

## Live Demo

[Coming Soon / To be deployed]

## Features:
- Generates a unique 8 character string via nanoid package.
- String along with original url stored in mongodb model url.
- Also, for each url, click count is tracked along with visit history.
- Analytics visible for all urls generated by user
- A dynamic navbar
- Uses EJS for Server Side Rendering of Service Page and other routes.
- clean modular project
- Session based authentication
- Uses express-session for session middleware
- Simple UI with copy to clipboard functionality


## What I Learned

- Setting up Express.js routes and controllers cleanly
- Building reusable EJS views with conditionals
- Handling POST requests and form submissions
- Connecting Node.js to MongoDB with Mongoose
- Using `nanoid` to generate short IDs
- Separating concerns between router → controller → model
- Returning data both via `res.json()` and `res.render()`
- Using middleware like `express.urlencoded()` for parsing form data
- Routing Login, Signup & Logout requests
- Authorization by linking mongodb collections by schema
